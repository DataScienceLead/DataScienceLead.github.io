		<h2>How to learn?</h2>
		<p>There are probably as many methods for learning as there are students. However, research on this topic have shown that there are some ways that are better than others. </p>
		<p>Reading <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-remember-everything-you-want-from-non-fiction-books-df17096d517f">Eva Keiffenheim's blog</a> can help you to imporve your learning skills. To summarize her blog. Learning efficiently should follow five steps: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Elaboration</li>
			<li>Retrival</li>
			<li>Spaced repetion</li>
			<li>Interleaving</li>
			<li>Self-testing</li>
		</ol>
		<p>To relate this to my econ-classes; I have some recommendations to my students. </p>
		<p><strong>First</strong>, in front of our lecture read my summary for the upcoming lecture. Take a look in our book at the relevant chapters. See if there are topics that you recognize and topics you find particularly interesting. <strong>Second</strong>, a day or two after the lecture read the chapter we just covered. Take notes, but focus your note-taking on challenges you find particularly difficult or interesting. Draw graphs, and think "what if" questions. <strong>Third</strong>, test your self. Do the quizzes in the book, put sufficient energy in the assignments, or discuss with your fellow students.</p>
		<p><strong>Last</strong>, do not study one course at a time. It is more efficient for your learning to read different books or study several topics at a time.</p>
